    <h4>How to make pancakes from scratch</h4>
    <p>It's not hard to make homemade pancakes — you just need a good recipe. That's where we come in! You'll find the step-by-step recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the dry ingredients together.</li>
        <li>Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.</li>
        <li>Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking until brown on both sides.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Its as simple as that!</p>
    <h4>When to flip pancakes</h4>
    <p>Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles start to form on the top and the edges look dry and set. This will usually take about two to three minutes on each side.</p>
    <h4>Storing and Reheating pancakes</h4>
    <p><strong>Storage: </strong>Store leftover pancakes in an airtight container in the fridge for about a week. Refrain from adding toppings (such as syrup) until right before you serve them so the pancakes don't get soggy.</p>
    <p><strong>Reheating: </strong>To reheat pancakes, simply warm up your pan, grease it up with butter and place in your pancake. Remember, you're not cooking it again, just heating it up.</p>
